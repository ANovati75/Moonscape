<span style="font-weight: bold;">Features and Points</span>:<br>
- Small, medium, large and extra large Netscape throbbers are included.<br>
- The throbber frame rate is adjusted to approximate Netscape's rate.<br>
- The size of the throbber icon is selected automatically based upon the<br>
&nbsp; type and size setting of the toolbar icons and, in the case of the<br>
&nbsp; Menu Bar, the bar on which the throbber is positioned.<br>
- Surprisingly, the large and extra large throbbers do not waste space in the<br>
&nbsp; vertical direction when used on a toolbar that has other buttons on it.<br>
- Cleaned up the overall appearance of the classic Netscape icons.<br>
- Improved the glint of light / plus sign graphic used in several icons.<br>
- Created several new icons: Go, New Tab, New Window, History, Tab Bar Close,<br>
&nbsp; Tab Bar Left Arrow, Tab Bar Right Arrow, Full Screen and more.<br>
- RSS feeds are indicated by orange bookmark folders.<br>
- The toolbar bookmarks use the same icon ('N' in a rectangle) as Netscape<br>
&nbsp; (on windows) does, which differs from the icon (green bookmark) used on<br>
&nbsp; links elsewhere.<br>
- Toolbar button text labels display in bright blue and dark blue during mouse<br>
&nbsp; hover and mouse click, respectively.<br>
- The MOONSCAPE theme can be seen in the following places:<br>

<br>
Customization - Position the throbber<br>
=====================================<br>
<br>
After restarting, you should do the following two steps.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Open the Customize Toolbar window - Right click on the home button and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; choose Customize... on the popup menu that appears.&nbsp; Alternatively, you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; can get there using the menu bar by clicking View &gt; Toolbars &gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Customize... .<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Relocate the Activity Indicator (a.k.a Throbber) - Assuming that your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; installation of Firefox is fresh, the Throbber will be located in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Customize Toolbar window.&nbsp; If needed, drag the throbber from it's current<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; position and drop it on the right hand side of the Navigation toolbar (to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the right of the search control).&nbsp; If after moving the Throbber you are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; satisfied with the layout of the browser then you can just click on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Done button and you are finished.&nbsp; If you would like to make things look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; as close as possible to one of the supported browser families (Netscape<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.x, Netscape 6.x, Mozilla M18+, SeaMonkey 1.0+), then continue on to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; following section.<br>
<br>
<br>
Customization - Netscape 4.x Toolbar Layout<br>
===========================================<br>
<br>
If you wish to make your Firefox browser look like the Netscape 4.x family of<br>
browsers, do the following steps.&nbsp; Otherwise, go to the following section.<br>
<br>
1. Make a Location Toolbar - In the Customize Toolbar window, click on Add New<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toolbar, enter Location Toolbar as the name, and click OK to continue.&nbsp; You<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; will see a new blank toolbar appear below the Navigation toolbar and above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Bookmarks toolbar.&nbsp; Drag the existing Location bar and Search bar from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Navigation toolbar and place them on the new Location toolbar so they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; appear in the following left to right order.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Location Toolbar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ----------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Bookmarks Menu&nbsp;&nbsp; [Fx4] (Appears with a dropmark symbol (down pointing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
triangle) on the right of the folder)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Location<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Search<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Subscribe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Fx4]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [Fx4] = New additions to Firefox 4.0.&nbsp; The bookmarks menu button<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; existed in Netscape 4.x, but not in any subsequent Mozilla<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; release, until Firefox 4.0.&nbsp; The subscribe button was in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firefox 3.6 in the Location bar, but not as a separate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toolbar button.&nbsp; The subscribe button is optional here, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be alternatively positioned on the navigation toolbar as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; described below.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
2. Customize the Navigation Toolbar - Now that the Location bar and Search<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; bar are not taking up space on the Navigation toolbar, drag and drop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; controls as needed to produce a Navigation toolbar control layout that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; matches the following left to right layout order.&nbsp; Note that items seven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; through 24 were not available in Netscape 4.x.&nbsp; They are presented here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; in an order that makes logical sense (to me, at least), and as they may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; have been arranged in a hypothetical evolution of Netscape 4.x that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; gained functionality.&nbsp; They are optional, and may be left out if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; wish to adhere to a more classic look.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigation Toolbar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ------------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 01. Back&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \__ One control<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 02. Forward&nbsp; /<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 03. Reload<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 04. Home<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 05. Print<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 06. Stop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 07. - Separator -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 08. New Tab&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Appears as a + symbol on right end of tab bar)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 09. List all tabs&nbsp;&nbsp; [Fx4] (Appears as a dropmark symbol (down pointing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. Tab Groups&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Fx4]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 11. New Window<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; 14. - Separator -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 15. Downloads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 16. Bookmarks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 17. History<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 18. - Separator -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 19. Cut<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 20. Copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 21. Paste<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 22. - Separator -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 24. Sync&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Fx4]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 23. Subscribe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Fx4]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 25. [Flexible Space]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 26. Activity Indicator (Throbber)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [Fx4] = New additions to Firefox 4.0+.&nbsp; List all tabs and Subscribe were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Firefox 3.6, but not as navigation toolbar buttons.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure to position a Flexible Space (25 above) item on the left hand side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Throbber to make the Throbber always appear at the far right end of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Navigation toolbar if the browser window size is expanded.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Icon Text - The final important step is to make the icons display their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponding text labels by selecting Icons and Text in the Show: drop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; down selector located in the lower left corner of the Customize Toolbar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; window.&nbsp; Also note that the Use Small Icons checkbox should be unchecked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to produce the large icons typically seen in Netscape.&nbsp; When you are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; finished customizing the layout, click Done to finish unless you want to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; do the following optional step.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Simulate Grippies - This optional step allows you to change the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; toolbars to approximate the appearance of toolbar grippies, though they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; will not function.&nbsp; Simply drag two Separator items to the left end of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the following bars: Menu Bar, Navigation Toolbar, Location Toolbar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and the Bookmarks Toolbar.&nbsp; Click Done to finish.<br>
<br>
<br>
Customization - Netscape 6-7.x, Mozilla M18+, SeaMonkey 1.0+ Toolbar Layout<br>
===========================================================================<br>
<br>
If you wish to make your Firefox browser look like one of the following<br>
browser families: Netscape 6-7.x, Mozilla Milestone 18 to 1.7.x, or<br>
SeaMonkey 1.0 to 2.x, then do the following steps.&nbsp; Otherwise, go to the<br>
following section.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Customize the Navigation Toolbar - With the Customize Toolbar window<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; open, Drag and drop controls as needed to produce a Navigation toolbar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; control layout that matches the following left to right layout order.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigation Toolbar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ------------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Forward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Reload<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Stop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Location<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Search<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Print<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Activity Indicator (Throbber)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, if you are trying to make Firefox look like one of the browser<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; families other than Netscape 6.x, be sure to read to the section titled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Included throbbers" to see how to make the throbber look like the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; from the browser family you desire.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Customize the Bookmarks Toolbar - Drag and drop controls as needed to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; produce a Bookmarks toolbar control layout that matches the following<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; left to right layout order.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bookmarks Toolbar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -----------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Home<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Bookmarks Toolbar Items<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Icon Text - The final important step is to make the icons display their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponding text labels by selecting Icons and Text in the Show: drop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; down selector located in the lower left corner of the Customize Toolbar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; window.&nbsp; Also note that the Use Small Icons checkbox should be unchecked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to produce the large icons typically seen in browsers.&nbsp; When you are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; finished customizing the layout, click Done to finish unless you want to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; do the following optional step.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Simulate Grippies - This optional step allows you to change the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; toolbars to approximate the appearance of toolbar grippies, though they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; will not function.&nbsp; Simply drag two Separator items to the left end of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the following bars: Menu Bar, Navigation Toolbar, and the Bookmarks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toolbar.&nbsp; Click Done to finish.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced Customization</span> (ANYTHING BELOW THIS SECTION HASN'T BEEN REVIEWED YET)<br>
<br>
Further customization of FOXSCAPE can be accomplished through use of<br>
subskins.&nbsp; Subskins are portions of a theme that are not enabled by<br>
default.&nbsp; They can optionally be enabled by the user.<br>
<br>
I have included two subskin templates which will allow you to easily<br>
pick and choose subskin features to be enable.&nbsp; This is done by simply<br>
un-commenting lines to enable their associated subskins.&nbsp; The templates<br>
can be seen by entering the following address into the address bar:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;chrome://browser/skin/config<br>
<br>
Copy each template text block from the page above and paste each one into<br>
the file specified in the comments at the top of each text block.&nbsp; Be<br>
sure to place the text blocks at the specified position (top or bottom)<br>
in each file.<br>
<br>
Now you can un-comment lines in the copied templates to enable their<br>
associated subskins.&nbsp; For example, in the userChrome.css file, you can<br>
enable the modern keyhole style back and forward buttons subskin by<br>
changing the following line:<br>
<br>
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Enable_keyhole_back_and_forward_buttons.css"); */<br>
<br>
to it's un-commented form:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Enable_keyhole_back_and_forward_buttons.css"); <br>
<br>
After saving your changes, restart Firefox to make the changes active.<br>
Now you should see the modern keyhole style back and forward buttons.<br>
<br>
I tried to name each subskin in a way that would clearly describe the<br>
function it performs.&nbsp; The subskin name is capitalized in the sample line<br>
below to illustrate where it occurs on each template line:<br>
<br>
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/SUBSKIN-NAME.CSS"); */<br>
<br>
Experiment by un-commenting one line at a time to learn what each subskin<br>
does.<br>
<br>
Note: Starting in FOXSCAPE version 3.03 I relocated all base theme .css<br>
file changes to separate subskins.&nbsp; These separate subskins are exposed<br>
as entries in the 0-config-template.css file ( accessed by going to<br>
chrome://browser/skin/config ) and are the default subskins loaded by<br>
FOXSCAPE.&nbsp; Each default subskin will be in the format depicted below.<br>
<br>
/* -import url("ADDRESS"); */ /* -------------------------------- DEFAULT */<br>
<br>
These default subskins are not meant to be un-commented.&nbsp; I changed the "@"<br>
character that should be on the left of "import" to a "-" character to make<br>
the default subskin lines visually stand out from the other subskins and to<br>
serve as a mental reminder to not use these subskins.&nbsp; These subskins are<br>
here to allow you to see the default settings that FOXSCAPE will have and to<br>
allow you to view the code that produces the named result.&nbsp; The following<br>
section will describe how to view a subskin's code (content).<br>
<br>
A result of my moving all base theme .css file changes to separate subskins<br>
is that it will allow me to produce new versions of FOXSCAPE more easily.<br>
So, this translates into less time for the next major update's release. :-)<br>
<br>
<br>
Using FOXSCAPE subskins with other themes<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
All FOXSCAPE subskins that have names that end in "_Fx.css" should work with<br>
themes other than FOXSCAPE.&nbsp; If you wish to use one of these subskins with<br>
a theme other than FOXSCAPE, you must copy the complete content of the<br>
subskin and paste it into the appropriate user .css file (userContent.css<br>
or userChrome.css).&nbsp; Alternatively, you could paste it into a file stored<br>
on your hard drive and use it by entering a line into the appropriate user<br>
.css file (userContent.css or userChrome.css) similar to the following:<br>
<br>
@import url("file:///c:/FOXSCAPE/include.css");<br>
<br>
In that example, the copied content of the subskin is stored in a file<br>
called include.css .&nbsp; It is stored in a folder called FOXSCAPE in the root<br>
of the C: drive on a Windows based computer.<br>
<br>
To see the content of a FOXSCAPE subskin, enter it's address into the<br>
address bar in Firefox while FOXSCAPE is enabled.&nbsp; Below is an example of<br>
a subskin address from a line in the templates:<br>
<br>
A line from the templates:<br>
<br>
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/SUBSKIN-NAME.CSS"); */<br>
<br>
The subskin address from the template line above:<br>
<br>
chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/SUBSKIN-NAME.CSS<br>
<br>
<br>
My preset templates<br>
-------------------<br>
In addition to the templates mentioned above, I have also included the<br>
two templates that I am presently using in my installation of FOXSCAPE.<br>
<br>
These will allow you to get a taste of what can be done with the included<br>
subskins.&nbsp; You can use my preset templates by simply adding one line to<br>
two files.<br>
<br>
1. Copy the following line and insert it at the top of userChrome.css<br>
<br>
@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/0-MyUserChrome.css");<br>
<br>
2. Copy the following line and append it at the end of userContent.css<br>
<br>
@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/0-MyUserContent.css");<br>
<br>
After saving your changes, restart Firefox to make my preset templates<br>
active.<br>
<br>
You may view the content of my two templates by entering the following<br>
addresses into the address bar and pressing enter:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/0-MyUserChrome.css<br>
<br>
&nbsp;chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/0-MyUserContent.css<br>
<br>
You will then be able to see which subskins have been enabled.&nbsp; You can<br>
also use these two addresses in place of the following address<br>
<br>
&nbsp;chrome://browser/skin/config<br>
&nbsp;<br>
in the steps described at the beginning of the Advanced Customization<br>
section.&nbsp; You will then be able to alter my settings to your liking.<br>
<br>
<br>
The profile-directory/chrome/ folder<br>
------------------------------------<br>
The userContent.css and userChrome.css files mentioned in this readme<br>
file are located in the chrome folder that is stored in the <br>
profile-directory folder.&nbsp; The profile-directory folder will be in a<br>
different place on almost every machine.&nbsp; The location is affected<br>
by the operating system type and version, as well as user name and<br>
other factors.&nbsp; So, this makes it difficult to describe the location<br>
in this file.&nbsp; An example of where you would find the chrome folder<br>
on a Windows XP based computer appears below:<br>
<br>
C:\Documents and Settings\[Windows Login Name]\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[Random String].default\chrome\<br>
<br>
[Windows Login Name] and [Random String] will vary.<br>
<br>
A new feature in Firefox 3.6+ can be used to open the profile directory,<br>
allowing you to simply open the chrome folder that contains the<br>
userContent.css and userChrome.css files mentioned in this readme.<br>
<br>
To open the profile directory, go to the about:support address or go<br>
to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information... on the menu bar.&nbsp; Once that<br>
page loads, click the Open Containing Folder button under Application<br>
Basics.&nbsp; Your screen should display a window containing the files that<br>
are in the profile folder on your computer.<br>
<br>
Take a look at the following web pages for additional information on<br>
subskins and the location of the profile-directory folder:<br>

Un-commenting<br>
-------------<br>
Un-comment lines by removing the leading /* and trailing */ comment<br>
indicators.&nbsp; You *must* be certain to remove both leading and trailing<br>
comment indicators for a given line or things will not function properly.<br>
<br>
When un-commenting lines in the templates, it is recommended that you<br>
replace the leading /* characters with two spaces characters.&nbsp; That<br>
enables you to easily see which lines are enabled by making them stand<br>
out from the commented lines.&nbsp; If you decide to disable an enabled line,<br>
just replace the removed /* and */ comment indicators and remove the two<br>
leading space characters if present.<br>
<br>
After making comment changes, be sure to restart Firefox to make the<br>
changes active.<br>
<br>
<br>
Additional Theme Notes<br>
======================<br>
<br>
Internal viewable readme<br>
------------------------<br>
This readme file is accessible from Firefox once the FOXSCAPE theme is<br>
installed and activated.&nbsp; It can be viewed by entering the following<br>
address into the address bar and pressing enter:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;chrome://browser/skin/readme<br>
<br>
Once entered, you will be forwarded to the following longer address:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/readme.txt<br>
<br>
You will then see this document in the main browser window.<br>
<br>
NOTE:<br>
As far as I know, no one has ever provided theme documentation internal to the<br>
theme itself *and* provided an address (like that above) to directly view it.<br>
This manner of providing internal documentation can simply display a text file<br>
or it can be expanded to include HTML and other media files.&nbsp; The main benefit<br>
of providing internal documentation is lack of need for, or reliance upon,<br>
a web site.&nbsp; Theme creators who do not have a web site can still provide good<br>
documentation.&nbsp; Additionally, themes that have their respective web site<br>
disappear incur less damage with respect to their ability to be understood<br>
(configured) by new users.&nbsp; It is my hope that this technique is embraced by<br>
others and used in their themes.&nbsp; Theme creators using this technique should<br>
be mindful of not creating bloat by including an excess of media files.<br>
Lastly, if the Firefox developers are listening, please consider the creation<br>
of a standard protocol for developers to follow when providing internal<br>
documentation.&nbsp; As part of the protocol, there could be a standard URL<br>
provided by Firefox - about:theme - which would link to a specific file path<br>
within the theme.&nbsp; Alternatively (or additionally), there could be a Readme/<br>
About/Info/Help button made available for each theme in the Tools&gt;Add-ons&gt;<br>
Themes panel.&nbsp; The benefit of having buttons on each theme is that there<br>
would not be a need to have the theme active to be able to view the<br>
associated documentation.<br>
<br>
UPDATE (July 2008):<br>
I recently discovered someone else who has included theme documentation within<br>
themes.&nbsp; "incognu" has several themes for SeaMonkey (and other browsers) which<br>
have an "about.html" file.&nbsp; His technique is similar to the one I am using,<br>
though the file name and path in the theme differs from mine.&nbsp; The address<br>
used in the browser to view his documentation<br>
(chrome://global/skin/about/about.html) also differs from mine.&nbsp; He does not<br>
presently have any themes for Firefox.&nbsp; To see his work, visit the following<br>
link: http://incognu.com/themes.xhtml<br>
<br>
<br>
Internal icon pack<br>
------------------<br>
The internal icon pack can be downloaded and installed by entering the<br>
following address into the address bar and pressing enter or clicking go:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;chrome://browser/skin/iconpack<br>
<br>
Follow the instructions that appear on that web page.<br>
<br>
<br>
Included throbbers<br>
------------------<br>
Below are the descriptions of, and subskin entries for, the throbber files<br>
included in FOXSCAPE.&nbsp; Refer to the "Advanced Customization" section to<br>
see how to use the subskin entries below.<br>

<br>
<br>
Included image files<br>
--------------------<br>
There are five splash/logo files included in the FOXSCAPE theme.<br>
These images may be accessed from a customized about:blank page (also<br>
described in this file) or from extensions, such as the Splash<br>
extension.<br>
<br>
There are also six .htm files included to demonstrate the included<br>
images.&nbsp; You can go to the address of each .htm file to get an idea<br>
of what the images will look like when called from a custom about:blank<br>
page or, to an extent, the Splash extension.<br>
<br>
These demonstration .htm files may also be used as your home page by<br>
placing the address of one into the Home Page field in the Main tab on<br>
the Options screen.&nbsp; When using one as your home page, you can get<br>
almost the same effect as if you had installed the Splash extension or<br>
a custom about:blank page without actually doing so.<br>
<br>
There is one extra .htm (0.) file relative to the number of included<br>
image files (five).&nbsp; This extra .htm file is included to demonstrate<br>
what a custom gray about:blank page (described in this file) will look<br>
like.<br>
<br>
Here are the links to the image files and their associated .htm files.<br>
<br>
0. No image - gray background - like about:blank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No image file for this .htm file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )<br>

<br>
Using the Splash! extension<br>
---------------------------<br>
Included in this theme are images which can be used with the "Splash!"<br>
Firefox extension, which is available at the following address:<br>
<br>
### NOTE: Unfortunately, this extension has not been updated in quite a<br>
long time and is not able to be used in Firefox 4.0+.&nbsp; I hope that it,<br>
or a similar extension will be made available to allow for splash screens<br>
in Firefox 4.0+.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Splash! 2.0.2 (or newer) by mrtech, slyfox<br>
&nbsp; http://AddOns.Mozilla.org/addon/2995<br>
<br>
The recommended settings for "Splash!" are as follows:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Splash Settings<br>
&nbsp; General<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [/] Show Splash on Startup<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ] Close splash when main window loads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Auto-close Timeout (1000 = 1 sec): 8000&nbsp;&nbsp; (Default: 3000)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Background Color:
transparent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Default: #FFFFFF)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Window Style: padding: 0px;<br>
&nbsp; Image<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Image URL (ex: file:///c:/image.png):
chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/spl/splash-1.gif&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Default: chrome://branding/content/about.png)<br>
&nbsp; Text<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [/] Hide splash text completely&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Default: [ ])<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [/] Hide progress
meter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Default: [ ])<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Override "loading..." text (leave blank for default):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Text Color: #000000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Text Style: font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;<br>
&nbsp; Miscellaneous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ] Play sound on startup<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound URL (ex: file:///c:/sound.wav):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Opacity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ] Use Opacity (value range is from 0-1 Ex. '.4')<br>
<br>
You can change the "Image URL" to any one of the included image file<br>
addresses described elsewhere in this file.<br>
<br>
<br>
Custom about:blank page<br>
-----------------------<br>
The Netscape 4.x browsers would start up (if no home page was specified)<br>
with a gray colored page.&nbsp; When new windows were created they also<br>
appeared with a gray colored page.&nbsp; Even though there was no formally<br>
defined about:blank page in Netscape, the about:blank page is the<br>
Firefox equivalent to Netscape's initial gray page.<br>
<br>
If you would like to make Firefox's about:blank page appear like the<br>
gray page in Netscape, either add the following line of text to the<br>
bottom of your chrome\userContent.css file or un-comment the existing<br>
line in your chrome\userContent.css file.&nbsp; See the Advanced Customization<br>
section for details.<br>
<br>
@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Gray_about_blank_Fx.css");<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you might want to include an image in the center of the<br>
about:blank page to give your empty about:blank page a bit of style.<br>
I have provided an example of a customized about:blank page that displays<br>
a FOXSCAPE splash image that disappears after 5 seconds and leaves a<br>
static FOXSCAPE logo.&nbsp; If you would like to try out this example, either<br>
add the following line of text to the bottom of your<br>
chrome\userContent.css file or un-comment the existing line in your<br>
chrome\userContent.css file.&nbsp; See the Advanced Customization section for<br>
details.<br>
<br>
@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Gray_about_blank_with_splash-3.css");<br>
<br>
If you would like to create a customized about:blank page with a different<br>
image than the one in my example, you can extract the complete content<br>
of the subskin example above and place it at the bottom of your<br>
chrome\userContent.css file, as described in the "Using FOXSCAPE subskins<br>
with other themes" section, but in this case use the subskin with FOXSCAPE,<br>
and then you can change the image name in the url("IMAGE_NAME") line in<br>
the extracted subskin content to any one of the included image file<br>
addresses described in the "Included image files" section of this file.<br>
You can even use an image file (.png, .gif, .jpg) located on your hard<br>
drive by using an image name similar to the following example.<br>
<br>
url("file:///c:/FOXSCAPE/image.png")<br>
<br>
In that example, the image file on your hard drive is stored in a file<br>
called image.png .&nbsp; It is stored in a folder called FOXSCAPE in the root<br>
of the C: drive.<br>
<br>
To clarify, the existing line would be changed from:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background:-moz-dialog
url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/spl/splash-3.gif") no-repeat fixed
50% 50% !important;<br>
to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background:-moz-dialog url("file:///c:/FOXSCAPE/image.png") no-repeat fixed 50% 50% !important;<br>
<br>
<br>
