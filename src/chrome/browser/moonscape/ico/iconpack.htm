<h2>Download and Install the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack</h2>
<h4>Click one of the following:</h4>
<a href="./icon-pack-readme.txt" title="Click here to view the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack for Windows readme" onmouseover="window.status='View the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack for Windows readme';return true;" onmouseout="window.status='';return true;">View the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack for Windows readme</a><br>
<br>
<a href="./foxscape-icon-pack.zip" title="Click here to download FOXSCAPE Icon Pack for Windows" onmouseover="window.status='Download FOXSCAPE Icon Pack for Windows';return true;" onmouseout="window.status='';return true;">Download FOXSCAPE Icon Pack for Windows</a><br>
</center>
<br>
After clicking the link above, a dialog box will appear.  Select the
Save File option and then click the OK button.  After downloading
the foxscape-icon-pack.zip file, you can install it by extracting the
folder contained in it.  Put the extracted folder into the browser\chrome
folder in the folder where your Firefox program is installed.  For
example, on Windows XP the default location for the Firefox browser\chrome 
folder is <b>C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\browser\chrome</b> .  The Firefox
browser\chrome folder may be in different locations on different versions
of windows.  Once the extracted folder is in the Firefox browser\chrome folder,
all newly opened Firefox windows will have their upper left corner 
icons styled to match FOXSCAPE.  If you would like to uninstall
the icon pack, just delete the extracted folder that you placed in
the Firefox browser\chrome folder.  (NOTE: At present, the prior procedure
is a bit more complicated than I would like it to be.  I hope to
improve this in a future FOXSCAPE Icon Pack release.)<br>
