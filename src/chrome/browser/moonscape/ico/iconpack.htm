<i>This icon pack and associated docs were originally created by Michael Walden, for the FOXSCAPE theme.</i>
</center>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>After clicking the link above, a dialog box will appear.  Select the Save File option and then click the OK button.</li>
<li>After downloading the moonscape-icon-pack.zip file, you can install it by extracting the folder contained in it.</li>
<br><b>The chrome folder doesn't exist by default and needs to be created.</b><br>
<li>Put the extracted folder into the browser\chrome folder in the
folder where Pale Moon is installed. For example, on Windows, the
default location for the Pale Moon browser\chrome folder is <b>C:\Program Files\Pale Moon\browser\chrome</b>.</li>

The Pale Moon browser\chrome folder may be in different locations depending on your current operating system.
<br>
<li>Once the extracted folder is in the Pale Moon browser\chrome
folder, all newly opened Pale Moon windows will have their upper left
corner icons styled to match Moonscape.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uninstalling</h3>
If you would like to uninstall the icon pack, just delete the extracted
folder that you placed in the Pale Moon browser\chrome folder.
<br>
(NOTE: At present, the prior procedure is a bit more complicated. An install script [bat/sh] is planned in a future release)<br>

<h3><a name="readme"></a>Readme</h3><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
There is an area of Firefox theming that is overlooked by most theme
authors.&nbsp; This area is overlooked because few theme authors are aware of<br>

its existence.&nbsp; The lack of awareness is probably due to the fact that
Firefox themes are not presently able to apply a theme to the area of
Firefox that is overlooked.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is an icon pack?</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
An icon pack allows you to change the icons that appear in the upper
left corner of titlebars on Firefox windows.&nbsp; These icons can also
be seen on the Windows taskbar.&nbsp; After installing an icon pack,
all newly opened windows will use the installed icons from the icon
pack.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Where can I get icon packs?</span><br>
Presently there is one main source for Firefox and Mozilla icon packs and related information located at:<br>
<br>
The Icon Packs Project - Firefox and Mozilla Icon Packs<br>
http://IconPacks.mozdev.org<br>
<br>
That web page is somewhat in disarray and not maintained well, but it
still has some good content.&nbsp; That site is the place where M.W.
learned about icon packs and without which FOXSCAPE Icon Pack would not
exist.<br>
<br>
Aside from that web site there are only a handful of other places on the web that have some icon packs.<br>
<br>
So now, for the first time (as far as I know), you can get a Firefox
icon pack in a theme, in this particular case, FOXSCAPE.&nbsp;
Hopefully, after others see what I have done here, theme authors will
include icon packs in their own theme creations using my method.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What was done while creating the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack?</span><br>
In spite of similarities to the icons in the following icon pack, only four of the icons in the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack come from it.<br>
(Note: the following icon pack is *not* made to work with Firefox.)<br>
<br>
Classic Icon Pack for SeaMonkey/Mozilla Suite (Windows and Linux)<br>
http://IconPacks.mozdev.org/packs/classic.html<br>
<br>
I extracted the bulk of the icons used in FOXSCAPE Icon Pack directly
from the files in Netscape (version 4.8) and a few from other sources.<br>
The following four icons are the ones that I took from the Classic Icon Pack mentioned above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;mozilla.ico<br>
&nbsp;package.ico<br>
&nbsp;venkman-window.ico<br>
&nbsp;import-window.ico<br>
<br>
These four icons are not included in Netscape 4.8 and are unique to the
Classic Icon Pack.&nbsp; They may have come from an early version of
Mozilla.<br>
<br>
When extracting the icons from Netscape I borrowed the file naming scheme that was used in the Classic Icon Pack.<br>
<br>
Classic Icon Pack comes with a collection of 36 icon files, 25 of which
are actually unique and the rest are duplicates.&nbsp; FOXSCAPE Icon
Pack<br>
comes with a collection of 59 icon files, 32 of which are unique.&nbsp;
The following seven icon files are unique to the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack over<br>
the Classic Icon Pack.<br>
<br>
Calendar.ico<br>
Communicator.ico<br>
Conference.ico<br>
image-file.ico<br>
Netscape.ico<br>
NSPage.ico<br>
reflib.ico<br>
<br>
In the following eleven icon files (which contain a total of 22 Images)
I have either made subtle improvements to the original graphic elements
that had small defects, or, in a few cases, created new icons.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why are there extra icon files?</span><br>
Only some of the icons included in the FOXSCAPE icon pack are actually
used by Firefox.&nbsp; I decided to leave the extra icons in here to
allow for easy conversion to a Mozilla Suite or SeaMonkey icon
pack.&nbsp; Also, I want to keep the extra icons in here for potential
future use with Firefox and to provide a complete archive of all of the
Netscape icons.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">File type icons</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
In the Classic Icon Pack and FOXSCAPE Icon Pack there are several icon
files which are meant to be used as icons that appear on the desktop of
your computer to represent various types of files.&nbsp; The Icon Packs
Project web site mentioned earlier gives no description of how one
would make these files become active in their computer's operating
system.&nbsp; I know it can be done, but for now, I will leave that to
you to figure out.&nbsp; In the future I might provide a description of
how to address this.&nbsp; Below is a list of the file type icons in
the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;gif-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;html-file.ico&nbsp; (copy from main-window.ico)<br>
&nbsp;image-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;jpeg-file.ico&nbsp; (copy from png-file.ico)<br>
&nbsp;js-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;png-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;url-file.ico<br>
&nbsp;xhtml-file.ico (copy from main-window.ico)<br>
&nbsp;xml-file.ico&nbsp;&nbsp; (copy from url-file.ico)<br>
&nbsp;xul-file.ico&nbsp;&nbsp; (copy from url-file.ico)<br>
&nbsp;NSPage.ico&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this can be used for a file type of your choice)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Program shortcut icons</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
There are several icons in the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack which could be used
to replace the standard icon used on program shortcuts to Firefox.<br>
Unfortunately, at the present time the only way to make these icons
active is to use a special utility program (like resource hacker) to
directly<br>
replace the default Firefox icons in the program with the ones in the
FOXSCAPE Icon Pack.&nbsp; You can refer to the Icon Packs Project web
site<br>
mentioned earlier to read more about using these icons.&nbsp; Below is
a list of the icons in the FOXSCAPE Icon Pack that are likely to be
used as<br>
replacements for the default program shortcut icons.<br>
<br>
Netscape.ico<br>
Communicator.ico<br>
main-window.ico<br>
mozilla.ico<br>
package.ico<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Closing</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
Feel free to use any parts of this icon pack in your own creations. All
I ask is that you give me (Michael Walden) and FOXSCAPE Icon Pack a bit
of credit in your creation.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.<br>
