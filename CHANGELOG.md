# Changelog

## Moonscape 6.10 - 2017-01-??
- Removed default subskins from global.css and moved it to its own css file (default_subskins.css)
  which is referenced by browser.css instead because it gets loaded 3 times in the past.
  This (somehow) led to an increase in memory usage. 
- Few tweaks and updates (namely the /mozapps/ directory, some icons, and devtools cleanup)
- Added homepage url to install.rdf

## Moonscape 6.00 - 2016-12-25
- Committed the project to GitHub, renamed.
- Updated manifest files (supports PM26-27)

## FOXSCAPE 5.16 - 2014-01-30 - This version supports Firefox 27.0.
- Minimal changes were made to support changes made to Firefox 27.
