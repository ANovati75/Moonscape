# Moonscape Messenger
![Preview](preview.png)

Features the classic theme that was used in earlier versions of Netscape. It is similar to the look of Netscape 4.x, Netscape 6+ "Classic" theme, Mozilla Suite M18+, and SeaMonkey 1.x "Classic" theme running on Windows. Most of the graphics were taken from the "[FOXSCAPE](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxscape/)" theme by Michael Walden.

A matching Pale Moon version of this theme available [here](https://addons.palemoon.org/themes/moonscape).
